# Converting the End of Line Sequence from CRLF to LF

First disable the autoCRLF in the git config by running the following command in your terminal git config core.autocrlf false

Then remove the cached files in the git. Run the following command: git rm --cached -r .

Then reset the project files by executing the following command to complete conversion. git reset --hard

That's it now all the files that have CRLF will be converted to LF.
